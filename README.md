## Project Description
Players will navigate the character through a sea of incoming meteoroids while attempting to avoid dangerous meteors. When players land on a flaming meteor, a trivia question relating to the Psyche mission is presented and the player must answer correctly to proceed without losing a life. The game also features a study mode that cycles through the trivia questions and encourages players to learn!

## Goal of this Project
The motivation behind our overall project was to create a fun and informational game that could be enjoyed by all ages. Although we made the game kid friendly, we incorporated many elements to keep things engaging for adults.

1. Normal: Manuever the character through a sea of incoming meteroids. Gray meteroids are safe to progress, flaiming meteroids are dangerous! Choosing a flaming meteroid prompts a question. Answering incorrectly penalizes the player with a life lost. Answering correctly allows them to continue at no cost. Reach 200 points to complete the game!
2. Time Attack: Try to beat your high score with only 60 seconds! 
3. Study Mode: Cycle through the question pool to learn about the Psyche mission and protect yourself from losing lives!
4. Instructions: Access a quick informational graphic on how to play!
